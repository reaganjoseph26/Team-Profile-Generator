  ## Test
  All test for this application were successfully passed. In the test folder when this repo is cloned locally to your pc, try adding another employee type. For instance, add a 'Associate.test.js' file to the _test_ folder. Using the jest package, write a test that creates a new instance of associate and expect that associate to be an object. Run the command 'npm run test or npm run test <filename> to have the test run. Initially that test should fail which is what you want. Create an Associate.js file in the lib/ folder and make sure Associate is exported. This should now give you a passing test. You will repeat this process with every new piece of information added to the Associate.js file. For an example, look through the other test provided in the _test_ folder.
